# Automated-CV
Here's my attempt at creating my cv using R Markdown and automating it to reduce the amount of time needed to update it.

The code used is derived from the work of Tinashe M Tapera through his ReproduceableResumeCV work: https://github.com/TinasheMTapera/ReproducibleResumeCV/tree/main/long_form_cv
